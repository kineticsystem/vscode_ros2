## Initialization of Visual Studio Code

For this guide, it is presumed that Visual Studio Code has already been installed on your system without additional extensions. In an Ubuntu environment, the extensions are commonly stored in the following directory:

```
~/.vscode
```

Upon launching VSCode, install the [Microsoft ROS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-iot.vscode-ros), followed by a restart of the editor.

<img height="80px" src="img/ros_extension.svg">

This extension will facilitate the installation of requisite dependencies such as [Microsoft C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [Microsoft Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extensions.

<img height="80px" src="img/cpp_extension.svg"><img height="80px" src="img/python_extension.svg">

Install the [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack), which provides Intellisense and C++ file navigation. This will install the [CMake extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake) too.

<img height="80px" src="img/cmake_extension.svg">

You may need to enable Intellisense in your VSCode Preferences Settings.

## Remote development over SSH

VSCode can be used to develop remotely over SSH. You must install an extension called [Microsoft Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh). This extension will also add a button on the left toolbar to display all available Docker containers.

<img height="80px" src="img/ssh_extension.svg">

Open the command palette and type: "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...".

## Development on Docker

VSCode can be used to develop on Docker. You must install an extension called [Microsoft Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), which you can use to connect to running containers. With this extension, you can also install your local VSCode extensions into the container in one click.

<img height="80px" src="img/dev_container_extension.svg"><img height="80px" src="img/docker_extension.svg">

You should also install the extension called [Microsoft Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker), which allows you to work with containers and images.

For more information, see VSCode document [Attach to a running container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/attach-container).

## Sourcing your ROS Dependencies

When you execute or debug a file in your project, it may fail to find its runtime dependencies and throw an error in the Debug Console. There are different solutions for this issue.

**Solution 1 - for local development**

You can source your project in the same Debug Console and try again.

`source install/setup.bash`

**Solution 2 - for local development**

You can modify the user `.bashrc` to source your project whenever you attach VSCode to the container.

**Solution 3 - for docker containers**

If you do not want to run a command each time you start a debug session and you cannot modify the file `.bashrc`, here is a more versatile approach.

You want to execute a `source` command every time VSCode opens the container. The VSCode DevContainer extension allows you to edit the JSON container configuration file, providing a field for this purpose. Open the configuration file by clicking on the highlighted cog.

<img height="300" src="img/container_config.jpg">

Add the following field to modify the `.bashrc` each time you connect VSCode to the container. `TAG` is a unique ID to verify if the command has already been added.

```json
"postAttachCommand": "grep -qF 'TAG' $HOME/.bashrc || echo 'source project-workspace/install/setup.bash # TAG' >> $HOME/.bashrc"
```

The container configuration file is usually stored somewhere inside this folder:

```bash
$HOME/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/
```

## How to build with Colcon

To run the `colcon` command from VSCode, you need to create the file `tasks.json` within the `.vscode` folder and populate it with the following content:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "colcon: build (debug)",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": [
        "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash;",
        "colcon build",
        "--symlink-install",
        "--event-handlers console_cohesion+",
        "--base-paths workspace-path",
        "--cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"
      ]
    },
    {
      "label": "colcon: clean",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": ["cd project-workspace;", "rm -rf build/ install/ log/;"]
    },
    {
      "label": "colcon: test",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": [
        "cd project-workspace;",
        "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash;",
        "source install/setup.bash;",
        "colcon test", 
        "--packages-select <package-name>",
        "--event-handlers console_direct+;"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To build a package, this may also work.

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "colcon: build (debug)",
      "type": "colcon",
      "group": "build",
      "args": [
        "build",
        "--symlink-install",
        "--event-handlers console_cohesion+",
        "--base-paths project-workspace",
        "--cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Modify the file according to your ROS2 distribution and project location.

Choose _"Terminal â†’ Run build task..."_ from the menu to build your project. The system will automatically locate and initiate the build task specified in the aforementioned `tasks.json` file. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut:

`Ctrl + Shift + B`

Using the same approach, you can also execute any ROS2 launch files.

## How to build with CMake

Building your code with CMake from within the IDE is also possible. Here is a sample configuration to add to the file `tasks.json`

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "CMake Configure",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "cmake",
            "args": [
                "-S", ".",
                "-B", "build",
                "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release",
                "other options..."
            ],
            "options": {
                "env": {
                    "C_INCLUDE_PATH": "path to C include files...",
                    "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH": "path to C++ include files...",
                    "LIBRARY_PATH": "path to libraries...",
                    "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "path to CMake modules...",
                    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "path to libraries...",
                    "PATH": "path to executables, including compiler and cmake..."
                }
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "CMake Build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "cmake",
            "args": [
                "--build", "build"
            ],
            "options": {
                "env": {
                    "C_INCLUDE_PATH": "path to C include files...",
                    "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH": "path to C++ include files...",
                    "LIBRARY_PATH": "path to libraries...",
                    "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "path to CMake modules...",
                    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "path to libraries...",
                    "PATH": "path to executables, including compiler and cmake..."
                }
                }
            },
            "group": "build",
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$gcc"
            ],
            "dependsOn": ["CMake Configure"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Working in C++

If you open an existing ROS2 project that contains C++ source code, you may observe that VSCode generates a `.vscode` folder containing two configuration files:

```
c_cpp_properties.json
settings.json
```

If `c_cpp_properties.json` is not created, you can create a new one by opening the command palette and typing _"C++: Edit Configurations (UI)"_.
Update it to match roughly the following content:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "browse": {
        "databaseFilename": "${default}",
        "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false
      },
      "includePath": [
        "/opt/ros/humble/include/**",
        "/usr/include/**",
        "add here your project include files"
      ],
      "name": "ROS",
      "intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64",
      "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/gcc",
      "cStandard": "gnu11",
      "cppStandard": "c++17 "
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```

**:warning:Warning:** Do not implicitly add the include files of your install folder, for example, by adding `"${workspaceFolder}/**"` to your include path. This will seriously confuse Intellisense and yourself when developing.

There are two additional parameters worth mentioning.

```json
"configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
"compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json"
```

If you can build your application with Colcon before opening VSCode, you can use the generated file `compile_commands.json` to feed Intellisense. This configuration overrides the `includePath` parameter. It is more precise but requires a build folder, which is not always the case.

### Navigation and Shortcuts

You may conveniently toggle between `.cpp` and `.hpp` files using the following keyboard shortcut:

`Alt + O`

### Debugging tests

Another useful extension is [C++ TestMate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matepek.vscode-catch2-test-adapter) to launch and debug GTests directly within VSCode.

<img height="80px" src="img/testmate_extension.svg">

Please note that, for this extension to work correctly, you may need to source your ROS repository before starting up VSCode.

To debug your test, you must create a `launch.json` file inside your `.vscode` directory. The file is automatically created for you when you debug your first test.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "GDP: launch",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "enter program name, for example, ${workspaceFolder}/../build/path_to_executable",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "preLaunchTask": "add your build task here. e.g. colcon: build",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        },
        {
          "description": "Set Disassembly Flavor to Intel",
          "text": "-gdb-set disassembly-flavor intel",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Working in Python

More information is available here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

### Intellisense

When you open an existing ROS2 Python project, IntelliSense does not find your ROS2 Python modules or your local package modules. To solve the issue, create a file `settings.json` with content matching roughly the following:

```json
{
  "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
    "/opt/ros/humble/lib/python3.10/site-packages",
    "/opt/ros/humble/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages",
    "/my_project/build/package1",
    "/my_project/build/package2"
  ],
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "/opt/ros/humble/lib/python3.10/site-packages",
    "/opt/ros/humble/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages",
    "/my_project/build/package1",
    "/my_project/build/package2"
  ]
}
```

All Python dependencies are stored in the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. Unfortunately, VSCode does not use it. To get the list of all libraries, source your project and type the following bash command:

```bash
IFS=:; for path in $PYTHONPATH; do echo "\"$path\","; done
```

### Sorting imports

To sort imports in a Python module, open the command palette and type _"Organize imports"_. You can also use the following shortcut:

`Shif + Alt + O`

### Debugging Python files

To debug a normal Python file, you must create a `launch.json` file inside your `.vscode` directory.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Current File",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${file}",
      "args": ["--arg1", "value"],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "justMyCode": true
    }
  ]
}
```

To debug a ROS2 Python launch file, you can open a command palette and type _"ROS: Run a ROS launch file (roslaunch)"_ to add a new launch configuration to your `launch.json`. You can also add it manually.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "ROS: Launch",
      "type": "ros",
      "request": "launch",
      "target": "/absolute-path/launch-file.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

The ROS2 extension allows you to debug a running node as well.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "ROS: Attach",
      "type": "ros",
      "request": "attach"
    }
  ]
}
```

Remember to add the following additional argument to your node in the launch file:

```python
my_node = launch_ros.actions.Node(
    ...
    prefix=["gdbserver :3000"],
)
```

Following is a more complex solution that requires you to modify the Python file. Add this code to the end of the launch file to convert it to a normal Python file:

```python
def main():
    ls = launch.LaunchService()
    ld = generate_launch_description()
    ls.include_launch_description(ld)
    return ls.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Using an "opaque function" allows you to debug the values of launch parameters. However, with the previous change, you'll need to modify the launch file, as demonstrated in the following example.

```python
def launch_setup(context, *args, **kwargs):
    my_param = LaunchConfiguration("param_name")

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription(
        [
            DeclareLaunchArgument(
                "param_name",
                default_value="param_value",
                description=("param_description"),
            ),
            OpaqueFunction(function=launch_setup),
        ]
    )
```

In VSCode, we can add a breakpoint and display the content of this variable with a watch:

```python
my_param.perform(context)
```

### Discover and execute tests

Test discovery in VSCode does not work perfectly, and sometimes it does not find your tests automatically.

You can add them manually by appending the following lines to your `settings.json`:

```json
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
  "python.testing.cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/path-to-test-folder/",
  "python.testing.pytestPath": "/usr/bin/pytest-3"
```

Your tests should now be available under the testing view on the left activity bar.

If you do not need to debug your tests, you can always run `colcon test` as described previously.

## Tips

### Highlight current tab

Add the following to your configuration file `settings.json`:

```json
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
      "tab.activeBorder": "#ffffff",
      "tab.activeBackground": "#373737"
  }
```
